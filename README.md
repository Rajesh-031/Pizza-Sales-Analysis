Unleashing the Power of AWS for Data Analysis on Pizza Orders! 

I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I utilized AWS services to perform data analysis on a pizza orders dataset. Here's a quick rundown of the process:

1. Data Storage with AWS S3: Stored raw CSV files in AWS S3, ensuring secure and scalable data storage.

2. Data Preprocessing with AWS Glue: Leveraged AWS Glue for data cleaning and transformation. Created and ran a crawler to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with the metadata of our dataset.

3. Data Analysis with AWS Athena: Performed high-level queries using AWS Athena to gain valuable insights from the pizza orders dataset. The combination of these powerful tools allowed for efficient and effective data analysis.

 Key Highlights:
- Seamless data storage in AWS S3.
- Automated data preprocessing and cataloging with AWS Glue.
- Quick and insightful querying using AWS Athena.


This project showcased the cooperation of AWS services in handling large datasets and extracting meaningful insights, all while maintaining data integrity and scalability.
